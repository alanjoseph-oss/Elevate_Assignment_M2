    <p class="para">C++ was created by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1979, to serve as an extension to the general-purpose, object-oriented programming language C. Over the years, C++ has played a crucial role in the development of operating systems, web browsers, databases, and games.
    </p>
    <p>C++ was standardized by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1998 as ISO/IEC 14882:1998 and most recently ratified the latest version in December 2017 as ISO/IEC 14882:2017. And although many believe that languages such as C++ are antiquated and have little use in modern computing, that sentiment is wrong.</p>

    <h1>C++ Most Common Applications</h1>
    <p class="para">The first question you might ask yourself is, “Why C++?” After all, there are so many languages that are better suited for today’s service-first, mobile-centric world. And although C++ isn’t found in mobile apps or web applications, it has quite an important listing of applications and use cases that still depend upon this aging language. What applications, you ask? Consider the following.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="container mt-3">
    <h2>Games</h2>
    <p class="para">C++ is the language used to build most console and Windows games. If you have any plans on working with large gaming companies, having C++ in your toolkit is unavoidable. There are a number of reasons why C++ is such a good language for games. One reason is that it gives you plenty of control over memory management. C++ also has a vast number of libraries that can be used for designing complex graphics.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="container mt-3">
    <h2>Desktop applications
    </h2>
    <p class="para">Because C++ includes all of the necessary libraries and tools, it makes it easier to develop GUI desktop applications. In fact, many of the most popular desktop applications on the market are developed with C++. Applications like:

    </p>
    <div class="container mt-3">
        <ul class="list-group list-group-flush">
          <li class="list-group-item">Adobe Photoshop, Premiere, and Illustrator
        </li>
          <li class="list-group-item">Web browsers like Firefox and Chrome
        </li>
          <li class="list-group-item">MySQL database
        </li>
          <li class="list-group-item">MongoDB
        </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
  </div>
  <div class="container mt-3">
    <h1>Operating Systems
    </h1>
    <p class="para">Although the Windows kernel is written in C, most everything else is written in C++. That includes the Windows desktop. On the Apple side of things, the macOS device drivers and its Finder application are written in C++. Lesser known operating systems that benefit from C++ are HaikuOS, Symbian OS, and IBM OS/400. As well, the KDE desktop environment (for the Linux operating system) is written in C++.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="container mt-3">
    <h1>Embedded systems
    </h1>
    <p class="para">Embedded systems are everywhere: In your refrigerator, on your wrist, in your car, GPS systems — just about every piece of electronics that has become “smart.” Because C++ is so good at working with hardware, it makes for an ideal language for embedded systems.

        In fact, at one point there was a dialect of C++, called Embedded C++, that was specifically designed for embedded systems. Embedded C++ was defined by a group of CPU manufacturers (NEX, Hitachi, Fujitsu, and Toshiba) to address the shortcomings of C++ for embedded systems. A restricted subset of C++, based on EC++, was adopted by Apple and used to create all I/O Kit device drivers for macOS, iPadOS, and iOS.

  <p>A programming language is a way for programmers (developers) to communicate with computers. Programming languages consist of a set of rules that allows string values to be converted into various ways of generating machine code, or, in the case of visual programming languages, graphical elements.</p>

  <h1>1.Java</h1>
  <p><a class="link-opacity-10" href="java.html">Java</a>
  often appears at the top of programming languages rankings thanks to its huge popularity, rooted mainly in one thing: its “write once, run anywhere” (WORA) principle: any compiled Java code can run on any platform that supports Java without having to recompile it first. That’s possible thanks to the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), which runs on a Virtual Machine to provide it with that cross-platform capabilities.

  <h1>2.Python</h1>
  <p><a class="link-opacity-10" href="python.html">Python</a> A lot of beginners that have gone online to ask which programming language should they learn first hear Python as the first answer. That’s because the language has a strong emphasis on code readability, ease of use, and flexibility. All of that means that beginners can quickly learn it and start working on pretty much any application they can think of.</p>
  <p>Though Python can be used to build everything from business applications to games, there are some strong suits for it. For one, the language is frequently used for data analysis, scripting, and scientific research, mainly because it includes a robust set of tools for that. But Python is also great for web app development and even for the creation of AI-based applications.

  <h1>3.C++</h1>
  <p><a class="link-opacity-10" href="c++.html">C++</a> A successor to C, the idea behind C++’s development was to add higher-level paradigms to C but also keeping the low-level qualities present in it. Since its inception, C++ has evolved quite a lot to include object-oriented, generic, and functional features. C++ is a compiled language that has many compilers to work on many different platforms, thus extending its usability.
   </p>
  <p>Given its predecessor, C++ boasts notable computing performance, which is the reason why it’s mostly used for system programming and embedded systems. Thus, it’s often used to create device drivers, game engines, image and audio software, telecommunications networks, and interpreters.
